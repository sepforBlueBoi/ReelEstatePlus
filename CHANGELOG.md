# CHANGE-LOG/Dev-Log

The changelog is actually a dev log suckas

## Dev-Log

### day 1
im starting the Dev log on jan. 29 2026. just to clarify, this is NOT when i started the game. it started in early 2025, but ive been slapped around.

Who is this for? me...presumably. as i expect no one else to see this. // THIS IS A LIE. I plan to show ts off after im done.

Things i plan to do: Refix REP/modules/Casino/Tokenizer, Redo slots, and start on Shop...hopefully.

okay writing this on the day AFTER...freak that. i basically just finished the tokenizer...a shame

### day 2
Jan 30, 2026. after yesterdays...progress today i will only plan to finish the text in the tokenizer, then push to start slots. maybe today will be hold more progress then yesterday. 

**1:06**: turns out there was a bug in save_stuff.py. fixed it. also i am trying to make sure when switching areas it feels smooth and not cluttered. tokens is ALMOST done. a few more lines of time.sleep(), some testing, repeat till its done.

**2:23**: i changed the name of Saves to Save_Modules to stop confusion between saves and Saves (Both Dir), now the only thing its Save_Modules and save_module is a thing. capital different and one is a Dir while the other is a file. also finished with the tokenizer. next step: SLOTS!! 

**2:31**: WHAT HAVE I DONT. It's Alive. wtf
    .
    .
    .
    JOKING. im wasting more time. :)

**4:14** im geting back to work. read alot of homestuck :)  Time to start on slots again. 

**4:50** slots animation is done. im gonna set up the function in Casino.py, then push it to github, then bug test.

**5:40** Slots is done. untested, but done. 

Day 2 is done. :]

### day 3
Jan 31 2026. yesterday went according to plan. today the plan is to finish slots/bugtest and add scripting, set up save/quit, saves in Casino, and then afterwards if i have energy add the dev console.
I think today can have lots of things since all the said things are quite small. save quit is a simple prompt and check. scripting is write it in lore.json, add the lines to the slots function in Casino.py, then import save, make sure the save slot is in Casino.py, then add saves throughout Casino.py. simple.

**12:46** Slots is done, with a few tweaks to the Token store timing wise, and a few clear()s. feels good to be caught up. sent the executable in a zip file to the QA        members in hopes they find bugs i can fix. and if they can't then we are golden. :)

**1: 09** I've decided after my short break to start on the save/quit function

**3:14** OMG. just ran into so many syntax errors in the save quit function. also turns out pygame isnt good at reporting errors :(. but it works, and a svae quit function exists.

**4:37** dev console in progress. im done for today. im tired. the save/quit thing killed my momentum. dev console WILL be finished tomorrow. i will make sure of it. 

noticable less action then yesterday, but simple how it is i guess. and progress IS progress. :)

### day 4
Feb 01, 2026. with the most recent progress, and the making of Static, i do believe today will hold plenty of progress. The Plans for today is to finish the Dev console, and start on the shop. i do think the shop will take tomorrow to finish with the scale of it, but it should be super good...while writing that ive decided to also work on the inventory with the shop. this way i can see whats happening :).

### day 5
Feb 05, 2026. i have made little progress as of day 4. as in i did a small thing to the dev console, and took a long break.
so plan for today is ACTUALLY FINISH THE DEV CONSOLE!! Thank you :)

Have me some dr thunder, i am READYYY

**11:53** I have fixed roulette...again. now there is a way to leave lol. and also Dev console is DONE. on to the Shop/inventory, im hyped :)
      I will be starting With the inventory, just cause =_=

**7:39** I am done for today. inventory module started as a class. 

### day 6
Feb 06, 2026. Inventory work, and adding comments and notes in dev_stuff is on the agenda. 
I adjusted the repo structure to be more clear and readable to newbies, and just anyone in general.
Yesterday i added CONTRIBUTING and requirements so people can help debug.

### day 7
Feb 7, 2026. okay, i was wrong. yesterday (the 6th) was just be making sure everything else was smooth. the repo, the discord server, etc. other then that not much happened other then more comments. with all that done it IS inventory time.

**12:37** After getting the basic display of the inventory working, im quite excited for it. imo its gonna be the most interactive thing i built so far. :))
    prolly the most interactive too.

also i wanna talk about how the REPO for REstate+ is getting so many views...

![Repo stats](Images/Git_stats.png)

I never thought something i made would get this kind of attention, bots or not.

**1:57** Made the icon and updated README with appropriate information.

**3:22** fully fleshed out inventory structure, with good timing and formatting. starting on the shop

**3:45** im stalling again, the save_stuff has been updated, preparing for shop and other things. really dont wanna go and do this. so many items. but it has gotta be done. i guess first step is doing shop item replicas.

**5:19** made the shop folder+file, and have been upgrading the current savefiles to make room for the shop. kinda brain numbing, but will be worth it.

### day 8
Feb 8, 2026. some decent progress happened yesterday. i dont expect as much, but i have plans >:), though the shop still scares me. i dont know how im gonna improve it compared to the last one. i mean other then more items, and obv actually getting sales to work. i mean, i guess just making it have a better UI too. which is also the plan. i guess casheer dialogue would work. but i'd like to implement that with the other NPCs.

**8:27** i have done zero progress and its 8pm. ive started on the shop :)
