## What is Reel Estate+
This is Reel Estate+, Reel Estate was my first *real* coding project, based off of a stream bots gambling command. since then Reel Estate has evolved, and its time to modulize it, and give it color(colorama).

Reel Estate features:
* Gambleing
    * slots
    * roulette
* fishing
* a shop
* COLOR(Reel Estate+ feature)
* achievments
* npcs and side quests
* collectables
* and more, especially with this new version!

## Structure

The game modules can be found in the REP/ folder.

**REP** - REP/ is split into three main folders, constants/ which holds all the dialogue, save data, and other text based thing used cross session, core/ whic has all the main major things, such as the menu, and main game look, and Modules/ which has just about everything else such as Casino/ or Misc/.

**LEGACY** - LEGACY/ has Reel_Estate_8.1 which was the lastest version of the orginal Reel Estate, It is here as a blue print.

**/** - The root folder has all the github info, requirements.txt, REP/, and LEGACY/. setup.py was to make pyinstaller work, same with ReelEstateplus.egg-info.
