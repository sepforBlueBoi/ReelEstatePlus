# README

The Readme is actually a dev log suckas

## Dev-Log

### day 1
im starting the Dev log on jan. 29 2026. just to clarify, this is NOT when i started the game. it started in early 2025, but ive been slapped around.

Who is this for? me...presumably. as i expect no one else to see this. // THIS IS A LIE. I plan to show ts off after im done.

Things i plan to do: Refix REP/modules/Casino/Tokenizer, Redo slots, and start on Shop...hopefully.

okay writing this on the day AFTER...freak that. i basically just finished the tokenizer...a shame

### day 2
Jan 30, 2026. after yesterdays...progress today i will only plan to finish the text in the tokenizer, then push to start slots. maybe today will be hold more progress then yesterday. 

1:06: turns out there was a bug in save_stuff.py. fixed it. also i am trying to make sure when switching areas it feels smooth and not cluttered. tokens is ALMOST done. a few more lines of time.sleep(), some testing, repeat till its done.

2:23: i changed the name of Saves to Save_Modules to stop confusion between saves and Saves (Both Dir), now the only thing its Save_Modules and save_module is a thing. capital different and one is a Dir while the other is a file. also finished with the tokenizer. next step: SLOTS!! 

2:31: WHAT HAVE I DONT. It's Alive. wtf
